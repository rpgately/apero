The following graphs were created using GGplot when the base model was not created in R (i.e., all you have is an excel file or CSV file of estimates and confidence intervals because your mate Billy asked you to make him a graph but your mate Billy still insists on using Microsoft Excel despite you repeatedly telling him how good R is).

Click on each graph for the relevant code.
